### Overview
This project implements a Coffee Maker application in Java, complete with a robust test suite using **JUnit** for unit testing and **Mockito** for mocking dependencies. The tests ensure the reliability of core functionalities including recipe management, inventory tracking, and the coffee-making process.

### Features
- **Recipe Management:** Add, edit, and delete recipes while validating inputs.
- **Inventory Control:** Monitor and update ingredient levels (coffee, milk, sugar, chocolate) to ensure proper functioning.
- **Beverage Preparation:** Simulate coffee-making with proper validations such as checking if enough ingredients are available and handling transactions.
- **Testing Excellence:** Comprehensive test coverage using JUnit and Mockito, ensuring each component behaves as expected and external dependencies are effectively simulated.

### Technologies Used
- **Java** - Main application development.
- **JUnit** - Framework for unit testing.
- **Mockito** - Library for creating mock objects.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
